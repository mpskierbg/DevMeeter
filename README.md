I utilize the MERN stack to create a social network for web developers. It has authentication capabilities that use bcryptjws and jwtoken. I used mlabs for the back end. All new users/profiles are saved in the database. Finally I have deployed to heroku. THe app can be viewed at: https://calm-citadel-53866.herokuapp.com/
